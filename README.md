# Credit Card Payment Service Provider Forecasting Model 💳

A machine learning solution to optimize Payment Service Provider (PSP) selection for online credit card transactions, achieving **170% improvement in success rates** and **74% cost reduction**.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project addresses a critical business challenge at a major online retailer where manual PSP selection was achieving only a 20.3% success rate. Using machine learning techniques, I developed a predictive model that can automatically select the optimal payment service provider for each transaction.

## 🚀 Key Results

- **Dataset:** 50,410 real transactions from DACH region (Germany, Austria, Switzerland)
- **Time Period:** January - February 2019
- **Model Accuracy:** 73.0%
- **Success Rate Improvement:** +170.2%
- **Cost Savings:** 74.2% reduction (€10,886 on test set)
- **Projected Annual Impact:** €1.5M+ savings potential

## 💼 Business Impact

### Current System Problems:
- ❌ Only 20.3% payment success rate
- ❌ High processing costs (€1.76 per transaction average)
- ❌ Customer frustration from failed payments
- ❌ Manual rule-based PSP selection

### Solution Benefits:
- ✅ 73% prediction accuracy for optimal PSP selection
- ✅ 170% improvement in success rates
- ✅ 74% reduction in processing costs
- ✅ Automated, data-driven decision making

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Data Analysis:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Algorithms:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
- **Methodology:** CRISP-DM Framework

## 📊 Payment Service Providers

| PSP | Success Fee | Failure Fee | Performance |
|-----|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Simplecard | €1.00 | €0.50 | 15.8% success |
| UK_Card | €3.00 | €1.00 | 19.4% success |
| Moneycard | €5.00 | €2.00 | 21.9% success |
| Goldcard | €10.00 | €5.00 | 40.6% success |

## 🔍 Key Findings

1. **Multiple Payment Attempts:** 45.22% of transactions were duplicate attempts (same purchase, multiple tries)
2. **3D Security Impact:** 5.6% improvement in success rates when 3D security is enabled
3. **PSP Performance Variance:** Success rates range from 15.8% (Simplecard) to 40.6% (Goldcard)
4. **Geographic Patterns:** Consistent performance across Germany, Austria, and Switzerland
5. **Amount-Based Risk:** Higher transaction amounts show increased failure rates

## 🔄 Methodology (CRISP-DM)

### 1. Business Understanding
- Defined PSP optimization problem
- Established success metrics: success rate + cost minimization

### 2. Data Understanding
- Analyzed 50,410 transactions over 2 months
- Identified data quality issues and patterns
- Discovered multiple payment attempts problem

### 3. Data Preparation
- Handled duplicate payment attempts (reduced dataset to 37,825 unique purchases)
- Feature engineering: time-based, amount-based, and risk-based features
- Created interaction features and historical performance metrics

### 4. Modeling
- Tested multiple algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
- Cross-validation with 5 folds
- Selected Logistic Regression (72.98% CV accuracy)

### 5. Evaluation
- Business-focused metrics: cost savings and success rate improvement
- Error analysis: 0 false positives, 2,043 false negatives
- Model confidence analysis

### 6. Deployment
- Designed GUI for daily operations
- Created phased implementation strategy
- Developed monitoring and maintenance plan

## 📈 Model Performance

- **Accuracy:** 73.0%
- **Precision:** 100% (very conservative, no false positive predictions)
- **Recall:** 0.05% (only predicts success when extremely confident)
- **AUC-ROC:** 59.2%
- **Business Impact:** 170% success rate improvement, 74% cost reduction

## 🎛️ Proposed Solution Interface

The model includes a web-based dashboard for real-time PSP recommendations:

- **Transaction Input:** Amount, country, card type, 3D security status
- **PSP Recommendations:** Success probability and expected cost for each PSP
- **Confidence Levels:** Model uncertainty indicators
- **Performance Monitoring:** Daily success rates and cost tracking

## 🚀 Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Pilot Testing (2-4 weeks)
- Shadow mode alongside current system
- Compare model vs. manual decisions
- Performance data collection

### Phase 2: Limited Rollout (4-6 weeks)
- 20% of transactions using ML model
- A/B testing and monitoring
- Team feedback collection

### Phase 3: Full Deployment (2-3 weeks)
- 100% model-driven PSP selection
- Continuous monitoring and retraining
- Manual override capabilities
